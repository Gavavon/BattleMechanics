# BattleMechanics
 
This code is was originally designed to test stat mechanics and simulate battles to determine how long battles take and how much damage classes do.
This code now can auto create characters based on predetermined stats, check duration of battles, check stats, and simulate battles.

How to use Code:
* The program will ask you to decide what classes you want to build
* The code than gives you the stats for each character created
* Then allows you to choose if you want to simulate the battle or check average duration of combat
